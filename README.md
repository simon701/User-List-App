## Description
The **User List App** uses the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) to retrieve mock user data and dynamically renders each user's details in a card format. A filter was used to quickly search for the details based on city or company.

This web app was built using **HTML** which allows to structure the content of the page sich as layout, search input, header, and user card container.

Then using **CSS** we styled the page such as the layout, fonts, colors, cards design and spacing, transitions. We used **CSS grid** to arrange the cards in a clean and responsive layout.

Then using **JavaScript** which powered the dynamic functionality of the page. Here's how we used it:
1. Fetching and parsing the data from the API.
2. Rendering the user cards dynamically
3. Enabling real-time filtering based on user input
